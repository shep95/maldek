# GetStream.io Integration

This integration uses GetStream.io for real-time communication in Spaces.

## Setup

1. GetStream.io credentials have been configured with the following:
   - API Key: 5xmj3535vkam
   - API Secret: rtbf2u7zcvube9nhp9r79wbuvftdp88fvfh5bjqa2psz6kp8gkzkeads46wc7jkr

2. The integration is ready to use with Twitter-style Spaces functionality.

## Security Note

In a production environment, token generation should be performed server-side to prevent exposing your API secret. The current implementation is for development purposes only.
